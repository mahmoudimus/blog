:title: About Me
:slug: about

Hi! I'm Mahmoud Abdelkader (`pronounced`_ `mæħˈmuːd æbdəlkeɪdər`_), but, my
usual nickname is *mahmoudimus*.

I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco, CA. I'm the co-founder and CTO
of `Balanced Payments`_, a graduate of the `Y\-Combinator`_ Winter of 2011 class.

I was formerly the 4th engineer at `Milo.com`_, which was `acquired`_ by `eBay`_ in
December 2010 — it is still functioning today, powering the `eBay Local`_
initiative.

Before that, I worked as a high-frequency trading engineer at `Wells Fargo Securities`_
in New York City.

I'm passionate about hypermedia/RESTful APIs, web development, open source, and
Python — although, I love learning new languages.

I'm a die hard `emacs`_ user.

If you want to contact me, my footer has all the usual communication mediums. You'll
most likely find me hanging out on the ``#balanced`` irc channel on `freenode`_ helping
developers with their `Balanced`_ integrations.
