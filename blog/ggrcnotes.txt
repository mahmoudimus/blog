# what i had to do to setup ggrc-core

1. go to https://console.developers.google.com and sign up
1. create a project (if one does not exist)
1. you need to enable two apis:
  - gdrive api
  - gdrive picker api
1. go to https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=${project_id} and create:
  - API keys (no restrictions)
  - OAuth 2.0 client IDs (web application)
1. go to consent screen tab
  - add drive scope
  - add authorized domains
    - needs to be top level so .com, .net - not .io or .sh
    - must support https:// !

edit: found stuff here: https://github.com/google/ggrc-core/blob/dev/docs/source/support/deployment_and_update.rst


# docker stuff

- modify dockerfile to add bsdtar since there's an overlay bug
- in the Makefile change `tar -xzf` to `bsdtar -xzf`
- change redirect_uri keyword argument in `init_flow()` function in `ggrc/gdrive/__init__.py` to set https redirect uri
  `_scheme='https'`
- when connecting to docker instance, you must:
  - source /vagrant/bin/init_vagrant_env
  - db_reset
